## Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool**

### **Introduction**

With the increasing importance of data security, encryption plays a vital role in protecting sensitive information. This project focuses on implementing a basic cryptographic technique to demonstrate foundational encryption concepts using Python.

### **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a **Python-based Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)** that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text using a shift-based substitution algorithm.

---

### **Project Description**

The Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool is a GUI application developed using **Python and Tkinter**. It enables users to input plain text and apply a user-defined shift value to generate encrypted text. The same tool can also decrypt encrypted messages by reversing the shift operation.

The application preserves case sensitivity and ignores non-alphabetic characters, ensuring that spaces, numbers, and special symbols remain unchanged. The core encryption logic is implemented using ASCII value manipulation and modular arithmetic.
